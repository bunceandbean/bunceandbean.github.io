Hi! I'm Ben Lilley, an undergraduate computer science student at Purdue University. My about section is mostly just a more stylized resume, or perhaps a less stylized LinkedIn profile. Feel free to [email me](mailto:benlilleydev@gmail.com) or reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-lilley-).

</p>

* Worked with a dedicated team for 10 years to solve and perform yearly scientific problems.
* Over 7 state competition placements, with 4 global final placements.
* Achieved two second placements at global finals. You can watch our second place performance in 2019 [here](/assets/videos/2019-gf.mp4).
* Learned `Arduino` programming, `C++`, mechanical engineering, `RFID` technology, electronics engineering, and (most importantly) how to work with a team.

### OEIS
* Contributed the sequence [A360268](https://oeis.org/A360268/) to the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.
* I hope to contribute and edit more sequences in the future. Support OEIS if possible, the project deserves the resources.
