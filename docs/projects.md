What would a computer science student be without millions of unfinished side-projects?

Here you can find all of the projects I have worked on listed in chronological order (newest to oldest). Warning: some of these projects are outdated, broken, weird, useless, and/or stupid. But hey, where's the fun in making something useful?

### Ben's Treasury of Projects

* <div> <strong><u>benlilley.dev</u></strong> &lt;<a href = "https://github.com/bunceandbean/bunceandbean.github.io">Repo</a> <span style = "font-size: 80%">|</span> <a href = "https://benlilley.dev"> Live</a>> </div>

    * *Hey, that's this!* Built with Jekyll and GitHub pages. Blog posts and pages are rendered markdown files.
    * Added a "most recently played song" to the bottom of my about page. It displays using a Spotify iframe and some hacky last.fm and PythonAnywhere API scripts.
    <br>
    
* <div><strong><u>BillMates</u></strong></div>

    * In progress project for CS307 - Software Engineering I. Working with a small scrum team to develop a bill splitting application. 
    * Utilizing `AWS Lambda` and `MongoDB` to build backend logic and processes.
    * Public repository will be available at the end of the Spring 2023 semester.
    <br>
* <div> <strong><u>Every-Frame: Twitter Bot</u></strong> &lt;<a href = "https://github.com/bunceandbean/every-frame-twitter-bot">Repo</a> <span style = "font-size: 80%">|</span> <a href = "https://twitter.com/MrFoxFrames"> Live</a>> </div>

    * A Twitter bot to post every frame of a given .mp4 file. Written in `Python` with the Tweepy and OpenCV libraries.
    * Live version (linked above) ran from October to November of 2022 and showed every frame of Fantastic Mr. Fox.
    <br>
* <div> <strong><u>Advent of Code</u></strong> &lt;<a href = "https://github.com/bunceandbean/advent-of-code">Repo</a>> </div>

    * A repository full of my Advent of Code solutions. Have been n yearly participant since 2020.
    * One of these days I'll get every star... maybe when I graduate and no longer have homework.
    <br>

* <div> <strong><u>Fishers Enigma</u></strong> &lt;<a href = "https://github.com/bunceandbean/FishersEnigma">Repo</a>> </div>

    * A yearly puzzle game (ARG) created for my friends during high school. Unfortunately the live version no longer exists.
    * Written in pure `JavaScript`, `PHP`, and `HTML/CSS`. The website hosted a scoreboard and a place for teams to submit their answer to each "stage".
    * Puzzles included cryptography, stenography, riddles, scavenger hunts, and even deciphering radio broadcasts.
    <br>
* <div> <strong><u>SchedLink</u></strong> &lt;<a href = "https://schedlink.com">Link</a>></div>

    * A web-based scheduling application for Fishers High School students. Made with a team of developers from scratch. It was my first experience with "real" software development!
    * Utilized `PHP`, `JavaScript`, and `SQL` to manage backend processes for students.
    * Helped design architecture, styling, and internal applications.
    <br>

* <div> <strong><u>Organic Portfolio</u></strong> &lt;<a href = "https://github.com/bunceandbean/organic-portfolio">Repo</a> <span style = "font-size: 80%">|</span> <a href = "https://benlilley.dev/organic-portfolio"> Live</a>> </div>

    * An old project I did for my organic chemistry class. It contains some information regarding basic organic compounds.
    * Written in purely (terrible) `HTML/CSS`. We all have to start somewhere.
