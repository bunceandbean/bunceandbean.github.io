What would a computer science student be without millions of unfinished side-projects?

Here you can find all of the projects I have worked on listed in chronological order (newest to oldest). Warning: some of these projects are outdated, broken, weird, useless, and/or stupid. But hey, where's the fun in making something useful?

### Ben's Treasury of Projects

* <div> <strong><u>benlilley.dev</u></strong> &lt;<a href = "https://github.com/bunceandbean/bunceandbean.github.io">Repo</a> | <a href = "https://benlilley.dev"> Live</a>> </div>

    * *Hey, that's this!* Built with Jekyll and GitHub pages. Blog posts and pages are rendered markdown files.
    * Added a "most recently played song" to the bottom of my about page. It displays using a Spotify iframe and some hacky last.fm and PythonAnywhere API scripts.
